/**
 * Phase 0 — proves the Kotlin mirror still agrees with the Postgres authority.
 *
 * `zad_budget_state()` (migration `20260809120000_single_budget_authority.sql`) is the one
 * definition of every money figure zad shows; `BudgetMath`/`CycleMath` exist only so the
 * app can render instantly and keep working offline. Two implementations of one definition
 * is the arrangement that produced the original bug, and the only thing that makes it safe
 * is a test that fails the moment they part company.
 *
 * **The expected values below are not hand-derived.** Each one was produced by calling the
 * real function on the live database and pasting the answer back. To extend or refresh
 * them, run the query in the comment above each block against the project and paste the
 * new output — do not "fix" a failure by editing the expectation to match Kotlin. If these
 * disagree, the SQL is right and `BudgetMath.kt`/`CycleMath.kt` is what needs changing.
